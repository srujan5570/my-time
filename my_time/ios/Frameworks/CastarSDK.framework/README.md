# CastarSDK Framework

## Important Note

This is a placeholder directory for the CastarSDK.framework. You need to replace this directory with the actual CastarSDK.framework that you download from the CastarSDK developer portal.

## Steps to Replace

1. Download the CastarSDK.framework from the developer portal
2. Replace this directory with the downloaded CastarSDK.framework
3. Run `pod install` in the ios directory
4. Build the project

## Structure

The actual CastarSDK.framework should have the following structure:

```
CastarSDK.framework/
├── CastarSDK (binary)
├── Headers/
│   └── ... (header files)
├── Modules/
│   └── ... (module files)
├── Info.plist
└── ... (other files)
```

If you have any issues, please refer to the `MANUAL_SETUP.md` file in the ios directory.
