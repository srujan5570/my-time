- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/my_time/MyApplication.kt`
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

- `ios/setup_castar_sdk.sh`
- `ios/setup_castar_sdk.bat`
- `ios/README_IOS.md`

### Flutter
- `lib/main.dart` (already had MethodChannel implementation)

### CI/CD
- `.github/workflows/ios-build.yml` - Builds iOS IPA on every push to master/main
- `.github/workflows/android-build.yml` - Builds Android APK on every push to master/main
- `.github/workflows/release-build.yml` - Creates versioned releases with both APK and IPA

## Next Steps

1. **Download CastarSDK files**:
   - Download CastarSDK.aar for Android and place it in `android/app/libs`
   - Download CastarSDK.framework for iOS and place it in `ios/Frameworks`

2. **Run setup scripts**:
   - For iOS: Run the setup script in the ios directory

3. **Test the integration**:
   - Build and run the app on both platforms
   - Test starting and stopping the SDK with a valid client ID

4. **Deploy**:
   - Automatic builds will run on every push to master/main
   - For versioned releases, either:
     - Push a tag (e.g., `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags`)
     - Manually trigger the release-build workflow with a version number

## Known Issues

- The CastarSDK files need to be downloaded separately and placed in the correct locations
- iOS integration requires macOS for building and testing
- Minimum SDK versions required: Android 24+, iOS 12.0+

## GitHub Workflows

### iOS Build Workflow
Automatically builds an iOS IPA file on every push to master/main branch.

### Android Build Workflow
Automatically builds an Android APK file on every push to master/main branch.

### Release Build Workflow
Creates a proper versioned release with both APK and IPA files. This workflow can be triggered in two ways:
1. By pushing a tag with version format (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. By manually triggering the workflow and specifying a version number
